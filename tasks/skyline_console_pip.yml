# NOTE(jrosser)

# No attempt yet to install skyline-console from source, sykline-apiserver
# currently brings in skyline-console as a dependancy from pypi so none
# of the nodejs/npm/yarn build is done yet with this ansible role

# NOTE(jrosser) Feels pretty bad to point the webroot into the python venv
# to get the content from skyline-console, so copy it
#
